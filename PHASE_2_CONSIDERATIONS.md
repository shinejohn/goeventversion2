# Phase 2 Considerations - Post-Integration

**Note**: These items should be addressed AFTER we have a working system that builds and deploys successfully. Focus on Phase 1 integration first!

## To Address After Basic Integration Works

### 1. Database Schema Adjustments
- Verify all required tables exist
- Add missing fields as discovered
- Use CLI for modifications as needed

### 2. Environment Variables
- Review and add any missing configs discovered during integration
- Document all required variables

### 3. Deployment Configuration
- Build script updates for Magic Patterns assets
- Static asset handling for images/media
- CDN configuration for performance
- Edge function requirements
- Caching strategies

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Bundle splitting strategy for 95+ pages
- Lazy loading for route components
- Image optimization pipeline
- Critical CSS extraction
- Service worker for offline support

### 5. Error Boundary Handling
- SSR error boundaries for graceful degradation
- Client-side error recovery
- Logging and monitoring setup
- User-friendly error pages

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical components
- Integration tests for auth flows
- E2E tests for booking flows
- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarks

### 7. Internationalization (i18n)
- Magic Patterns hardcoded strings
- Makerkit i18n integration
- Date/time formatting
- Currency display

### 8. SEO Considerations
- Meta tags for event pages
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for events/venues
- Sitemap generation for dynamic routes
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- robots.txt updates

### 9. Third-Party Integrations
- Google Maps for venue locations
- Calendar integrations (Google/Apple)
- Social login providers
- Payment gateways
- Email marketing services

### 10. Migration Strategy
- Data migration from existing system
- User account migration
- URL redirects from old routes
- Gradual rollout plan
- Rollback procedures

### 11. Security Considerations
- Content Security Policy updates
- API rate limiting for new endpoints
- Input sanitization for user-generated content
- File upload security
- Payment data handling compliance

### 12. Analytics & Monitoring
- Event tracking setup
- Conversion funnel tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking (Sentry/Rollbar)
- User behavior analytics
