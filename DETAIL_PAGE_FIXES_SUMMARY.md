# Detail Page Fixes Summary

## Problem
All detail pages (events, venues, performers, etc.) were showing "not found" errors in production despite having valid data in the database.

## Root Cause
The queries in detail pages were using column names that don't exist in the production database. The code was written expecting certain fields that were never created in the actual database schema.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Event Detail Page (`/apps/web/app/routes/events/$id.tsx`)

**Fixed query fields in venue join:**
```typescript
// Before (incorrect fields):
venues!venue_id (
  latitude,          // ❌ doesn't exist
  longitude,         // ❌ doesn't exist  
  base_hourly_rate,  // ❌ doesn't exist
  profile_image_url, // ❌ doesn't exist
  parking_info,      // ❌ doesn't exist
  transit_options,   // ❌ doesn't exist
  nearby_amenities   // ❌ doesn't exist
)

// After (correct fields):
venues!venue_id (
  id,
  name,
  address,
  city,
  state,
  max_capacity,
  amenities,
  image_url,
  pricePerHour,
  description,
  is_verified
)
```

### 2. Venue Detail Page (`/apps/web/app/routes/venues/$venueId.tsx`)

**Fixed multiple field references:**
- Changed `capacity` → `max_capacity` in similar venues query
- Changed `profile_image_url` → `image_url` in performers query
- Fixed default values for non-existent fields
- Removed latitude/longitude from meta tags
- Used defaults for parking_info, transit_options, etc.

### 3. Performer Detail Page (`/apps/web/app/routes/performers/$performerId.tsx`)

**Fixed field mappings:**
- Changed `profile_image_url` → `image_url` in venue queries
- Changed `performer_reviews` table reference → `reviews` JSON field
- Updated field mappings in data object:
  - `social_media` → `social_links`
  - `base_rate` → `base_price`
  - `total_performances` → `shows_played`
  - `years_experience` → `years_active`
  - `average_response_time` → `responseTime`

### 4. Data Transformers (`/apps/web/app/lib/magic-patterns/data-transformers.ts`)

**Updated to use correct field names:**
- Venue: `price_per_hour` → `pricePerHour`
- Event: Removed latitude/longitude coordinate mapping
- Performer: Updated all field mappings to match actual database

## Fields That Need to Be Added to Database

A comprehensive log of missing fields was created in `MISSING_DATABASE_FIELDS.md`. Key missing fields include:

**Events:**
- latitude, longitude (for location mapping)
- ticket_url, series_id, age_restrictions
- highlights array

**Venues:**
- Location fields (latitude, longitude)
- Detailed amenity fields (parking_info, transit_options)
- Booking configuration (minimum_hours, deposit_percentage)
- Analytics fields (occupancy_rate, repeat_booking_rate)

**Performers:**
- Many booking-related fields
- Technical requirements
- Equipment and insurance information
- Separate performer_reviews table

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these fixes to production** - The immediate issue of "not found" errors should be resolved
2. **Add missing fields to database** - Use MISSING_DATABASE_FIELDS.md as a guide
3. **Update UI components** - Some components may need adjustment to handle missing data gracefully
4. **Consider data migration** - Some fields can be calculated from existing data

## Testing

After deployment, test each detail page type:
- `/events/{id}` - Event detail pages
- `/venues/{id}` - Venue detail pages  
- `/performers/{id}` - Performer detail pages

All should now load without "not found" errors, though some data may be missing until database fields are added.
