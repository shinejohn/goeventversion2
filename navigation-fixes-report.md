# Navigation & Component Integration Fixes Report

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Event Detail Navigation
- **Issue**: Event cards navigating to `/events/${event.id}` 
- **Status**: Route exists and properly integrated at `routes/events/$id.tsx`
- **Fix**: None needed - working correctly

### 2. ✅ Venues Page "Not Working"
- **Issue**: VenuesPage expecting `venue.location.neighborhood` but data didn't have location object
- **Fix**: Modified `routes/venues/index.tsx` to add location object structure
```typescript
location: {
  neighborhood: venue.neighborhood || venue.city || 'Downtown',
  address: venue.address || '',
  city: venue.city || '',
  state: venue.state || 'FL'
}
```

### 3. ✅ EventCard Venue Navigation
- **Issue**: EventCard trying to navigate to `/venues/${id}/${slug}` but route is `/venues/${id}`
- **Fix**: Updated EventCard.tsx venue link from `/venues/${event.venue.id}/${event.venue.slug}` to `/venues/${event.venue.id}`
- **Also Fixed**: Share popup URL from `/event/${id}` to `/events/${id}`

### 4. ✅ Book Route Missing

- **Status**: Route exists at `routes/tickets/index.tsx` and is properly integrated
- **Fix**: None needed - working correctly

## Remaining Verification Needed
The user's examples have been addressed, but there are 104 Magic Patterns pages total. A complete systematic check of all pages against their routes should continue to ensure 100% integration.

## Next Steps
1. Continue systematic check of all 104 Magic Patterns pages
2. Verify each page has a corresponding route
3. Check all navigation links point to correct routes
4. Ensure data is properly loaded and transformed for each component
