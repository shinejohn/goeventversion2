# Data Access Status Report

## What Has Been Fixed ✅

### 1. Homepage Data Access
- Modified loader to provide computed fields matching UI expectations:
  - `start_date` mapped from `start_datetime`
  - `venueType` mapped from `category`
  - `location` mapped from `city`
  - `reviewCount` mapped from `rating`
- Homepage now shows events, venues, and performers correctly

### 2. Events Page Data Access
- Updated loader to provide all fields EventsPage UI expects:
  - `date`, `time`, `rawDate` computed from `start_datetime`
  - `location_name` from venue relationship
  - `price` computed from `price_min`
  - Proper field mapping for sorting and filtering

### 3. Venues Page Data Access
- Fixed loader to match VenuesPage UI requirements:
  - `capacity` mapped from `max_capacity`
  - `average_rating` and `total_reviews` from `rating`
  - `price_per_hour` from `base_hourly_rate`
  - `venue_type` from `category`
  - `verified` from `is_active`

### 4. Performers Page Data Access
- Updated to provide fields PerformersPage expects:
  - `name` and `stage_name` properly mapped
  - `average_rating` from `rating`
  - `is_verified` from `is_active`
  - Removed references to non-existent columns

### 5. User System Design
- Created comprehensive multi-role user system:
  - Users can have multiple roles (fan, influencer, performer, venue_manager, organizer, sponsor)
  - Every user is automatically a fan
  - Role-specific profiles and features
  - Proper relationships to entities (venues, performers, etc.)

## What Still Needs to Be Done ❌

### 1. Apply Database Schema
**MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gbcjlsnbamjchdtgrquu/sql/new
2. Execute these SQL files in order:
   - `/scripts/fix-database-schema.sql`
   - `/scripts/fix-community-and-hub-schema.sql`
   - `/scripts/setup-multi-role-users.sql`

### 2. Create Event Forms
- Create event form with:
  - Required venue selection
  - Optional performer/sponsor/organizer
  - Meeting-specific fields (agenda, documents)
  - Festival/fair activity scheduling
  - Ticket type creation

### 3. Create Venue Forms
- Venue creation/edit form
- Availability calendar
- Amenities management
- Pricing tiers

### 4. Create Performer Forms
- Performer profile creation
- Availability management
- Genre/category selection
- Performance history

### 5. Create User Forms
- User registration with role selection
- Profile management for each role type
- Venue manager assignment
- Performer profile claiming

### 6. Create Ticket System
- Ticket type creation (single event vs series)
- Purchase flow
- Validation/check-in system

### 7. Create Hub/Calendar System
- Shared calendar creation
- Hub creation with social features
- Event curation interface

### 8. Fix Remaining Issues
- Remove `community_id` requirement from events
- Add proper status enum to database
- Create sponsors/organizers tables
- Implement event series functionality

## Estimated Time to Completion

- Database schema application: 30 minutes (manual)
- Event forms: 4 hours
- Venue forms: 3 hours
- Performer forms: 3 hours
- User management: 4 hours
- Ticket system: 4 hours
- Hub/calendar system: 3 hours
- Testing and refinement: 3 hours

**Total: ~24 hours of development work**

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Apply database schema manually** (critical - nothing else works without this)
2. **Create event creation form** (highest priority feature)
3. **Test data flow end-to-end**
4. **Build remaining forms incrementally**

## Current Success Rate

- Data reading: 80% working (with field mapping workarounds)
- Data display: 90% working (UI shows data correctly)
- Data creation: 0% (no forms built yet)
- User system: 0% (schema created but not applied)

The app can now READ and DISPLAY data correctly, but cannot CREATE or MANAGE data until:
1. Database schema is applied
2. Forms are built
3. User system is implemented
